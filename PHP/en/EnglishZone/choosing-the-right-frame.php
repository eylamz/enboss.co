        <h1>Choosing the Right Frame</h1>
        <hr class="titleHr">
          <p>Choosing the right frame for your aggressive inline skates is crucial for achieving the desired performance and maneuverability. In this guide, we'll cover three popular frame types: Flat Frame, Anti-Rocker Frame, and Plastic Anti-Rocker Frame. We'll explain the characteristics and benefits of each frame type. Let's dive in!</p>

          <h2><strong></strong>Flat Frame</h2>
          <p>
            The flat frame refers to using wheels of the same size on all four positions of your skate frame. This frame type offers a balanced and versatile skating experience, providing stability for jumps and maintaining control during various maneuvers. It allows for smooth transitions between different surfaces, enabling you to navigate obstacles with ease and confidence.</p>
            
          <h3>Benefits of Flat Frame</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong class="strongSubs">Versatility</strong><br>The flat frame allows you to perform a wide range of tricks and maneuvers, making it suitable for both street and park skating.</li>
            <li><strong class="strongSubs">Stability</strong><br>With wheels of the same size on all four positions, the flat frame offers enhanced stability, making it easier to land jumps and maintain control during fast turns.</li>
            <li><strong class="strongSubs">Maneuverability</strong><br>The balanced wheel configuration enables smooth transitions and agile movements, allowing you to navigate obstacles with ease.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2><strong></strong>Anti-Rocker Frame</h2>
         <p>The anti-rocker frame involves using two larger outer wheels and two smaller inner wheels, or grind wheels, in the middle. This frame type maximizes the space in the middle of the frame, allowing for enhanced grinding capabilities by reducing wheel-to-obstacle contact.</p>        
        
         <h3>Benefits of Anti-Rocker Frame</h3>
         
        <ul>
            <li><strong class="strongSubs">Increased Grinding Surface</strong><br>By using smaller grind wheels in the middle, the anti-rocker frame provides a larger surface area for grinding, making it easier to lock onto rails, ledges, and other obstacles.</li>
            <li><strong class="strongSubs">Reduced Wheel-Bite</strong><br>With less wheel-to-obstacle contact, the risk of wheel-bite (when the wheels get caught on an obstacle) is minimized, allowing for smoother and longer grinds.</li>
            <li><strong class="strongSubs">Enhanced Stability for Grinds</strong><br>The anti-rocker frame offers improved stability during grinds, making it easier to maintain control and balance while executing technical tricks.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Example image of anti rocker frame  -->
        <img class="dynamic-anti" alt="anti rocker frame">

        <h2><strong></strong>Plastic Anti-Rocker Frame</h2>
        <p>In this frame type, the inner wheels are replaced with plastic frame spacers or grind plates. The purpose of using plastic is to further reduce friction during grinds, allowing for smoother and longer slides.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Plastic Anti-Rocker Frame</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong class="strongSubs">Enhanced Slide Potential</strong><br>By replacing the inner wheels with plastic, the friction during grinds is significantly reduced. This enables smoother slides, allowing for longer and more controlled grinds.</li>
                <li><strong class="strongSubs">Reduced Wheel Wear</strong><br>Plastic spacers or grind plates experience less wear compared to traditional wheels, making them more durable and cost-effective for grinding.</li>
                <li><strong class="strongSubs">Minimal Maintenance</strong><br>Another advantage of using plastic anti-rockers or grind plates is that they do not wear out as quickly as wheels. This means that there is no need to regularly change the wheels, saving you time and money. The durability of the plastic anti-rockers reduces the overall maintenance requirements for your skates, making them a convenient and low-maintenance option for skaters.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Understanding the different frame types for aggressive inline skating is essential for optimizing your performance and achieving the desired skating style. The flat frame offers versatility and stability, while the anti-rocker frame is specifically designed for grinding. If you prefer even smoother slides, the plastic anti-rocker frame is worth considering. Choose the frame type that suits your skating style and enjoy pushing the limits of your aggressive inline skating skills!</p>
